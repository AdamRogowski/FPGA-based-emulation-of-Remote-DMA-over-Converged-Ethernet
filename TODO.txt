Introduce packets instead of just rate
Intoruduce NP with ECN marking/probability
Introduce random oscilation factor for the rates/delays
Accurate delay model between NP->RP

RP:
Add byte counter during FR
Model output rate explcitely, instead of constant drain
introduce delay modelling between RP->CP/NP

Introduce more flows? -> scheduling mechanism
Real-time simulation? x
